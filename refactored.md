# Refactoring Progress Tracking: Tensor Distributions and Tests

This document serves as a central reference for tracking the refactoring progress of `TensorDistribution` classes and their corresponding test files within the `research-tensordict` project. It provides an overview of completed work, ongoing tasks, and areas requiring attention, ensuring a single source of truth for the refactoring initiative.

## Refactoring Pattern Summary

A distribution or test is considered "refactored" if it adheres to the new `TensorDistribution` base class structure and follows the updated testing patterns, ensuring consistency, maintainability, and full integration with the `tensordict` ecosystem. This includes proper parameter handling, batching, and adherence to PyTorch distribution API conventions.

## Recent Refactoring Progress

This session focused on significantly expanding the coverage of fully refactored distributions and their corresponding test files. The following distributions were moved to the "Fully Refactored" category, with new comprehensive test files created for each:

**Partially Refactored → Fully Refactored (6 distributions):**
- `continuous_bernoulli.py` + test file created
- `dirichlet.py` + test file created
- `half_normal.py` + test file created
- `laplace.py` + test file created
- `log_normal.py` + test file created
- `student_t.py` + test file created

**Not Refactored → Fully Refactored (4 distributions):**
- `fisher_snedecor.py` + test file created
- `gumbel.py` + test file created
- `half_cauchy.py` + test file created
- `pareto.py` + test file created

**Previously Undocumented Distributions Now Tracked:**
The following 16 distributions were identified as existing but not previously documented in this tracking file:
- `lkj_cholesky.py` (needs test file)
- `logistic_normal.py` (needs test file)
- `low_rank_multivariate_normal.py` (needs test file)
- `mixture_same_family.py` (needs test file)
- `multinomial.py` (has test file - fully refactored)
- `multivariate_normal.py` (needs test file)
- `negative_binomial.py` (has test file - fully refactored)
- `one_hot_categorical.py` (has test file - fully refactored)
- `relaxed_bernoulli.py` (has test file - fully refactored)
- `relaxed_categorical.py` (has test file - fully refactored)
- `soft_bernoulli.py` (needs test file)
- `tanh_normal.py` (needs test file)
- `transformed_distribution.py` (needs test file)
- `von_mises.py` (has test file - fully refactored)
- `weibull.py` (has test file - fully refactored)
- `wishart.py` (needs test file)

**Test File Status Corrections:**
The following distributions were previously documented as missing test files but actually have comprehensive test coverage:
- `Bernoulli` - moved to fully refactored
- `Binomial` - moved to fully refactored
- `Cauchy` - moved to fully refactored
- `InverseGamma` - moved to fully refactored
- `Kumaraswamy` - moved to fully refactored

This systematic approach ensures that each distribution is thoroughly integrated and tested, contributing to a more robust and reliable `TensorDistribution` codebase.

## Progress Statistics

- **Total Distributions Identified**: 43 (excluding `__init__.py` and `base.py` in `src/tensorcontainer/tensor_distribution/`)
- **Fully Refactored Distributions**: 30 (69.8%)
- **Distributions with Test Files**: 30 (69.8%)
- **Distributions Missing Test Files**: 13 (30.2%)
- **Test Coverage Progress**: 30/43 distributions have comprehensive test files

## Next Priority Actions

1. **Create missing test files** for the 13 distributions without test coverage
2. **Verify implementation completeness** of distributions with existing test files
3. **Standardize test patterns** across all test files for consistency
4. **Document any special considerations** for complex distributions like `TransformedDistribution` and `MixtureSameFamily`

## Implementation Quality Notes

All distributions follow the established `TensorDistribution` base class pattern:
- Proper parameter annotation for tensor attributes
- Implementation of required abstract methods (`dist()`, `_unflatten_distribution()`)
- Integration with TensorDict ecosystem operations
- Adherence to PyTorch distribution API conventions

The test files provide comprehensive coverage including:
- Basic functionality tests (sampling, log_prob, etc.)
- Parameter validation and edge cases
- Device and dtype compatibility
- Batch shape handling
- Integration with TensorDict operations

This document will be updated regularly to reflect the ongoing refactoring efforts and maintain accuracy as the project evolves.
